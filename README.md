Problem statement can be found [here](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/j5vqc3j229b6u7/hzpndq5jv06214/j9lmr5b0mnxk/170_Project.pdf):

We reduced this problem to an instance of SAT (another NP-complete problem) and used the library solver [pycosat](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycosat) to efficiently find a solution. 

The algorithmically interesting portion of the project is located in `solver.py`
